Ranking: 2. CWE ID: CWE-306 CWE Description: Missing Authentication for Critical Function Explanation: CWE-306 indicates a failure to enforce authentication for sensitive operations, applicable here since VPN accounts with access to personal data did not have proper authentication measures like MFA in place. Ranking: 3. CWE ID: CWE-521 CWE Description: Weak Password Requirements Explanation: CWE-521 describes issues related to insufficiently robust password policies, which is relevant given the use of easy-to-guess usernames and lack of stronger authentication measures in the organization\u2019s systems. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Use of default account names like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest\" facilitated easy targeting for attacks. CWE ID: CWE-798 CWE Description: Use of Hard-coded Credentials Explanation: CWE-798 refers to the use of hard-coded credentials, such as default usernames and passwords, which an attacker can exploit to gain unauthorized access to systems. In this context, the use of default account names like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest\" allows threat actors to easily target these accounts for brute force attacks. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Use of default account names like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest\" facilitated easy targeting for attacks. CWE ID: CWE-521 CWE Description: Weak Password Requirements Explanation: CWE-521 describes the lack of strong password requirements, which can result in accounts being vulnerable to brute force attacks. The use of default account names, combined with potentially weak passwords, increases the risk of these accounts being compromised. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Use of default account names like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest\" facilitated easy targeting for attacks. CWE ID: CWE-732 CWE Description: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource Explanation: CWE-732 involves assigning incorrect permissions, which could allow unauthorized users to access critical resources. The use of default accounts like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest\" can lead to improper permission settings, allowing threat actors to exploit these accounts and elevate privileges. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) CWE ID: CWE-287 CWE Description: Improper Authentication Explanation: The lack of MFA for accessing VPNs, firewalls, and password files is a classic case of improper authentication. This vulnerability allowed threat actors to gain unauthorized access to the organization's network by compromising single authentication method credentials. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) CWE ID: CWE-798 CWE Description: Use of Hard-coded Credentials Explanation: The use of easy-to-guess default account usernames without additional authentication layers can be equated with the use of hard-coded credentials. The vulnerability is exacerbated by omitting MFA, which would mitigate the risk associated with default usernames. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) CWE ID: CWE-521 CWE Description: Weak Password Requirements Explanation: Even though the main issue is the absence of MFA, the organization's failure to implement strong access controls, such as enforcing complex password policies, contributes to the susceptibility of the network to unauthorized access once credentials are compromised. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Data not secured with encryption CWE ID: CWE-311 CWE Description: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data Explanation: The personal data stored on the servers was not encrypted, allowing threat actors easy access to sensitive information once they compromised the network. This directly led to data exfiltration and exposure on the dark web. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Data not secured with encryption CWE ID: CWE-522 CWE Description: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Explanation: The lack of encryption can also be viewed as insufficient protection of data that functions similarly to credentials (e.g., sensitive personal information), making it accessible and exploitable once the network was breached. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Data not secured with encryption CWE ID: CWE-200 CWE Description: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor Explanation: The absence of encryption resulted in unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive data to threat actors, ultimately increasing the severity of the data breach incident. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Dependency on outdated software CWE ID: CWE-676 CWE Description: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function Explanation: The use of outdated software like Windows Server 2008 R2 means continued operation with functions or binaries that are no longer supported, introducing risk due to the absence of patches and updates. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Dependency on outdated software CWE ID: CWE-1173 CWE Description: Improper Use of a Risky API Explanation: Operating on a legacy server without proper security support creates a reliance on risky APIs that should be either refreshed or replaced to meet current security standards. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Dependency on outdated software CWE ID: CWE-327 CWE Description: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm Explanation: Legacy systems may use outdated or broken cryptographic algorithms, increasing the risk of exploitation as they cannot adequately protect data against more modern attack vectors. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Lack of proactive security assessment CWE ID: CWE-284 CWE Description: Improper Access Control Explanation: The organization failed to implement reasonable access controls and did not enforce security practices such as the use of strong passwords or multi-factor authentication, contributing to security breaches. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Lack of proactive security assessment CWE ID: CWE-287 CWE Description: Improper Authentication Explanation: The lack of multi-factor authentication for VPN, firewall access, and access to password files highlights improper authentication mechanisms, leading to compromised security and data breaches. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Lack of proactive security assessment CWE ID: CWE-798 CWE Description: Use of Hard-coded Credentials Explanation: The organization used default account names like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest,\" which are similar to hard-coded credentials because they are predictable and easily exploitable by threat actors, undermining security."
