Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Use of default and easy-to-guess usernames CWE ID: CWE-1392 CWE Description: Use of Default Credentials Explanation: The vulnerability identified fits the description of CWE-1392 as it involves the use of default account names like \"Administrator\" and \"Guest\". Such default credentials align with the weaknesses described in CWE-1392, where there is a risk if administrators do not change them, potentially allowing attackers easy access. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Use of default and easy-to-guess usernames CWE ID: CWE-1393 CWE Description: Use of Default Password Explanation: While primarily concerning default passwords, this CWE also highlights the problem with default elements that simplify an attacker's job. The use of common, default usernames ties in with the described weaknesses of using easily bypassed, common credentials. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Use of default and easy-to-guess usernames CWE ID: CWE-1391 CWE Description: Use of Weak Credentials Explanation: The CWE-1391 describes weak credentials such as default or easily guessable names and passwords. This aligns with using default usernames that can be easily detected and exploited by attackers, contributing to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) CWE ID: CWE-308 CWE Description: Use of Single-factor Authentication Explanation: The organization\u2019s failure to implement MFA corresponds closely to the proposed CWE-308, which highlights the risks associated with relying solely on single-factor authentication. The breach led to unauthorized access and data exfiltration, demonstrating the importance of leveraging multi-factor schemes as a safeguard against such risks. Ranking: 2 Vulnerability Identified: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) CWE ID: CWE-307 CWE Description: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts Explanation: While the primary issue is the absence of MFA, the related risk is compounded by CWE-307. This CWE emphasizes the insufficient restriction of authentication attempts, which, when combined with single-factor authentication, can expose the organization to unauthorized access more easily. Ranking: 3 Vulnerability Identified: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) CWE ID: CWE-304 CWE Description: Missing Critical Step in Authentication Explanation: The title and description of CWE-304 focus on missing crucial authentication steps, which closely align with a failure to implement necessary authentication measures, such as MFA. This serves as a critical reminder of following robust authentication protocols to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Ranking: 1 Vulnerability Identified: Dependency on a vulnerable third-party component: The servers were running on legacy Windows Server 2008 R2, violating Secure Design Principles and increasing susceptibility to attacks. CWE ID: CWE-1395 CWE Description: Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party Component Explanation: The issue involves dependency on an outdated version of Windows Server 2008 R2, which is a third-party component with known vulnerabilities, fitting CWE-1395. The use of a legacy and unsupported system introduced security risks that facilitated the attack, aligning with the concept of relying on vulnerable third-party components. Ranking: 2 CWE ID: CWE-1329 CWE Description: Reliance on Component That is Not Updateable Explanation: The servers were running legacy software that is no longer supported, indicating that they cannot receive necessary updates or patches to address known vulnerabilities. This inability to be updated is directly linked to CWE-1329, as it leaves the system open to exploitation through unpatchable weaknesses. Ranking: 3 CWE ID: CWE-1357 CWE Description: Reliance on Insufficiently Trustworthy Component Explanation: Although Windows Server 2008 R2 was once a trusted component, its legacy status and vulnerability suggest it no longer meets modern security expectations. This aligns with CWE-1357, where reliance on insufficiently trustworthy components raises significant risks to the product and organization.
