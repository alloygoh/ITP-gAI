# ITP Project

## Project Overview

This project is a POC to process data breach PDF reports to identify vulnerabilities and map them to CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) IDs and process categories. It utilizes various libraries and tools to load, process, and analyze the data, and then generate relevant mappings and responses.

### Directory Structure

[utils](./utils): helper scripts to extract relevant data from the APQC PCF & CWE archives, dumping them to a JSON file to be used in the project.

[data](./data): JSON files generated by the helper scripts in [utils](./utils). These files are used in the main engine

[chroma_db](./chroma_db): directory where the Chroma vector stores are persisted. This directory contains the embedded data for CWE and process categories.

### Usage

`python3 main.py <path to pdf report>`

NOTE: Make sure to configure the .env file with your OpenAI API key before running the script.
